## SOLUTIONS

- ### Two Keys
  Solve by copy-pasting the no of A until they are divisible ( Basically increasing the greatest factor available).  
  Eg if n=16, we do 2+2->4+4->8+8  
  If not a factor, simply paste the earlier number of copied characters.  
  Eg if n=12, we do 2+2->4+4->8+4 (8 isnt a factor of 12)
